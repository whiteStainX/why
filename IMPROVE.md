# Code Review and Improvement Suggestions

This document outlines the observations from a code review of the `why` audio visualizer project and provides suggestions for improvement.

## 1. Project Structure and Dependencies

### AS-IS

The `main.cpp` file is responsible for argument parsing, configuration loading, and the main application loop. This makes the file lengthy and difficult to maintain.

### TO-BE

To improve modularity and readability, the argument-parsing and configuration-loading logic should be moved to a separate file (e.g., `init.cpp`). This will make the `main` function more focused on the application's primary lifecycle.

## 2. Error Handling

### AS-IS

The project currently uses a mix of return-code checking and a `last_error_` string in the `AudioEngine`. This approach is inconsistent and can make it difficult to trace the root cause of errors.

### TO-BE

A more structured and unified error-handling strategy should be implemented. This could involve using a consistent error-code system or custom exceptions for critical failures. This will make the code more robust and easier to debug.

## 3. Configuration Management

### AS-IS

The `AnimationConfig` struct is very large and contains parameters for all possible animations. This is not scalable, as it requires modifying the struct every time a new animation is added.

### TO-BE

The `AnimationConfig` struct should be refactored to be more generic. It should contain common parameters, and animation-specific parameters should be stored in a `std::map<std::string, toml::value>`. This will allow new animations to be added without changing the configuration struct.

## 4. Audio Engine Design

### AS-IS

The `AudioEngine` class is a large class that handles multiple responsibilities, including audio capture and file reading.

### TO-BE

The `AudioEngine` class should be split into smaller, more focused classes. For example, there could be separate classes for audio capture and file reading that conform to a common interface. This will improve modularity and make the code easier to test.

## 5. DSP Engine Design

### AS-IS

The `DspEngine` is tightly coupled to the `kissfft` library. This makes it difficult to switch to a different FFT library in the future.

### TO-BE

The `kissfft` library should be wrapped in an abstraction layer. This will decouple the `DspEngine` from the specific FFT implementation and make it easier to swap out the library if needed.

## 6. Animation Management

### AS-IS

The `AnimationManager` is currently a `static` global variable in `renderer.cpp`, and the animation-loading process involves an unnecessary layer of indirection. Additionally, the `AnimationManager::load_animations` method uses a large `if-else if` chain to create animation objects, which is not scalable.

### TO-BE

The following improvements should be made to the animation management system:

*   The `AnimationManager` should be instantiated in `main` and passed to the renderer. This will remove the global dependency and make the code more testable.
*   A factory pattern should be used to create animation objects. This will allow new animations to be registered with the factory at runtime, making the system more extensible and compliant with the Open/Closed Principle.
